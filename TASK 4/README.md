# TASK-4

Study about: -
1. IMUs and Flex sensors available in the market
2. The interface of Arduino with IMUs, Flex  sensors and Servos
3. Kalman filter 

Task: -
1. Write a code in Arduino to control servo motor along with IMU.
Follow the algorithm: -
Make use of two servo motors.
Connect the servos and IMU with the microcontroller and then attach the 2nd servo to the 1st servo and the IMU to the 2nd servo.
Irrespective of the previous position the IMU should reposition x and y to (0,0).

2. Draw a circuit diagram showing the necessary connections.

Documentation:

You need to make two documents.

Document 1-
Design the circuit according to the algorithm 

Format- Circuit.pdf or Circuit.doc

Document 2:- 
Write a code according to the algorithm.

Arduino Code :- Code.ino
