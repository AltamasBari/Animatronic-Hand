Code and Circuit diagram:-

1. Write a code in Arduino to control two servo motor.

            Follow the algorithm: -

            Turn LED ON

            Rotate Servo 1 to 0째 and Servo 2 to 180째

            Turn LED OFF

             Rotate Servo 1 to 180째 and Servo 2 to 0째

2. Make connection according to your will. Simulate the circuit in Tinker Cad- https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits
